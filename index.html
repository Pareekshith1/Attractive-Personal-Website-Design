                Greetings! I'm jhon-doe, a web developer and designer with a passion for creating visually 
                stunning and user-friendly websites. My expertise lies in HTML, CSS, and <br>JavaScript, and I have
                extensive experience in both web design and development.
                
                As a front-end developer, I pride myself on my ability to create websites that not only<br> look great 
                but also function seamlessly. With my skills, I can turn any design into a fully functional website 
                that is easy to navigate and optimized for search engines.

                I <br>have been freelancing in web design and development for a while now and have worked on several projects 
                that have received positive feedback from clients. I have a<br> keen eye for detail and strive for perfection 
                in all my work.

                Currently, I am pursuing my passion of arts while also taking up part-time<br> jobs 
                in web design and development, data entry, copywriting,and excel sheet entry. If you're looking for a reliable,
                experienced, and creative web developer, look no further!<br>

                <p class="bgp" id="p1">
                    Have you ever been fascinated by the magic behind websites? You know, that feeling when you click a button and 
                    it takes you to another page,<br> or when you hover over an image and it changes? Well, I certainly have! Hi, my 
                    name is jhon doe, and I am a web development enthusiast.<br><br>
            
                    To me, web development is like being a magician. Instead of rabbits and hats, I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
                    to create beautiful and interactive <br>websites. HTML is like the foundation of a building - it provides the structure
                    and content of a website. CSS is like the paint and decor - it adds the style and visual design. And JavaScript is 
                    like the wizard - it adds the magic and interactivity to the website.<br><br>
               
                    But web development isn't just about technical skills. It's also about creativity and problem-solving. I love coming 
                    up with new ideas and designs <br>for websites, and figuring out how to make them work using code. It's like solving a 
                    puzzle or cracking a code - once you figure it out, it's so satisfying!<br><br>
                
                    One of my favorite things about web development is the community. There are so many resources available online, from 
                    tutorials to forums to code<br> snippets. And there are so many people who are willing to help and share their knowledge. 
                    It's like being part of a secret club, but one where everyone is welcome and supportive.<br><br>
               
                    Of course, web development isn't always easy. There are times when I get stuck on a problem or spend hours trying to make
                    something work. But<br> that's all part of the fun. It's like a challenge, and when I finally figure it out, it's such a 
                    rewarding feeling.<br><br>
                
                    So if you're interested in web development, don't be afraid to dive in! There are so many resources available, and so many 
                    people who are willing <br>to help. And who knows, you might just discover a new passion and become a web development magician 
                    like me!<br>
